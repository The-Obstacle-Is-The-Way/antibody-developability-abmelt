Read 201 frames from md_final_covar_350.xtc (time 0 to 2000 ps)
Read reference structure for fit from md_350.tpr
Read index groups from index.ndx

Analysis group is 'Backbone' (684 atoms)
Fit group is 'Backbone' (684 atoms)
Analysis is non-mass weighted
Fit is non-mass weighted
Diagonalized the 2052x2052 covariance matrix
